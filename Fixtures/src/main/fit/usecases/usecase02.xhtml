        <h1>Use Case 02 : User orders lunch</h1>
        <h2>Main Scenario</h2>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>1 User logs in</li>
            <li>System informs user of the current balance and shows available products</li>
            <li>3 User selects lunch by adding available products to order</li>
            <li>4 System verifies the remaining balance and informs user of balance and order</li>
            <li>  repeat 3-4  till order complete</li>
            <li>5 User confirms choice</li>
            <li>6 System validates and updates balance, registers order</li>
            <li>7 System confirms order and wishes the User a nice day</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Alternatives</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>2a Remaining balance is too low to order any product</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>System informs user that nu order is possible</li>
                    <li><a href="usecase01.xhtml">User adds money to Balance</a></li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>2b Remaining balance is too low to offer all products</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>- 2b1 The System shows the products but makes them unavailable</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>6a User tries to cheat and confirms multiple orders of which the sum exceeds the balance.</p>
                <p>rationale : </p>
                <p>The user opens several sessions and builds several orders for which the total exceeds the balance. It depends strongly on the implementation but is a risk worth checking for. It serves to verify the validation is against the persistent record f the balance, not some cached value in a session or conversation.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Validation of remaining balance fails</li>
                    <li>System informs user the remaining balance is insufficient.</li>
                    <li>continue from 2</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
